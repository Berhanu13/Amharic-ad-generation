# AmharicAI-AdGen
## Project Goal: 
To generate creative and relevant Amharic ad content for Telegram channels, increasing the effectiveness of AiQEM's Adbar advertising solution.

## Background:
AiQEM is an Ethiopian startup specializing in AI and Blockchain solutions for businesses.
Adbar is their flagship AI-powered Telegram ad solution for targeted ad placement.
Growing Telegram use in Ethiopia necessitates adaptation of AI strategies for content generation.

## Project Proposal:
Develop an Amharic RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) pipeline for automatically creating ad content.
Leverage existing open-source LLM models with Amharic capabilities like:
Nous Hermes Mistral 8 7B
Amharic-finetuned LLama 2 versions (Samuael/llama-2-7b-tebot-amharic or iocuydi/llama-2-amharic-3784m)
Further fine-tune the chosen model on Amharic ad text data specific to Telegram channels.

## Use the RAG pipeline to generate:
Catchy ad headlines and body text based on campaign briefs (brand, product info)
Content tailored to the chosen Telegram channel's theme and audience

## Key Success Factors:
High-quality Amharic text embedding and generation capabilities of the chosen LLM model.
Fine-tuning on relevant ad text data to ensure content relevance and creativity.
Integration with Adbar platform for seamless ad generation and deployment.


## Expected Outcomes:
Increased Adbar-generated Amharic ad content led to higher click-through and engagement rates.
Improved ad targeting and relevance across the Telegram ecosystem.
Improved brand positioning and awareness among AiQEM clients.
